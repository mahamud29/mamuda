    <p>Every day, technology innovations transform the way people learn and how educators teach. In the last few years, the edtech field has attracted a lot of talented people, all with excellent knowledge bases and ideas. Though the edtech industry has been around for a few decades now, the last few years, in particular, have seen a surge in investment from both school districts and investors.<br>
    <br>The education market is currently worth around $5 trillion globally, and it is forecasted that education technology investment alone will reach $252 billion by the year 2020. This growing investment into edtech startups has created some exciting changes in the world of education. Naturally, with increasing capital, the number of edtech companies is also growing.<br>

    <br>Who are the top edtech companies in the world? The Edvocate editorial team has exhaustively researched companies in the edtech space and selected 10 of the top global edtech companies. To frame our methodology, we decided to define the term edtech company broadly. On this list, you will find startups, small and medium-sized businesses, as well as perennial juggernauts, etc. who are transforming the edtech space as we know it.<br>

<br>The companies that we chose are all active in the area of edtech, doing something influential in 2017, well-known throughout the edtech landscape, and making an impact globally. We are excited to witness how these companies continue to change the world this year, and we are anxious to see who will stand on the shoulders of these giants, and as a result, make our list next year.

	<div id="article2"><article></article><a href="page3.html"><h3> Kurd Tech app</h3></a><p></p><br>One of the most popular classroom behavior management apps is <strong>Kurd Tech</strong>. <strong>Kurd Tech</strong>allows teachers to track positive and negative behaviors for each student with just a few clicks. Each student has a unique icon which teachers can click on and note behaviors. Students earn points for good behaviors and lose points for bad behaviors, so it’s easy to incorporate ClassDojo in with a classroom reward system.<br>

<p><br>The reason that <strong>Kurd Tech</strong> is so popular is that it keep parents in the loop. Parents can get updates on how their child’s behavior was that day. If their child gained or lost points, they could see why. Students can also get alerts when their teacher adds or takes away points, so they know what they did without a verbal redirect in front of the class. This app allows parent and teachers to work together to nip behavior problems in the bud before they cause students to experience academic failure, which is a major factor when it comes to the decision to drop out.<br>
<br>Kurd Tech markets themselves as a “complete parent-teacher communication solution.” Kurd Tech believes that collaborating with parents is key to student success. This edtech platform creates an inclusive classroom community for teachers, students, and parents. Up-to-date schedules, newsletters, and important announcements are all available through Kurd tech as well as a space for organizing events, recruiting volunteers and discussing ideas. “Kurd Tech’s mission is to help teachers engage parents in the classroom by handling the busy work,” says Mahamud Ali, CEO, and co-founder of Kurd Tech. “Our service is carefully crafted to simplify logistics and communications issues in classrooms.”“Kurd Tech’s mission is to help teachers engage parents in the classroom by handling the busy work,” says Mahamud Ali, CEO, and co-founder of Kurd Tech. “Our service is carefully crafted to simplify logistics and communications issues in classrooms.”</p></div>

<div id="article3"><article><a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/03/180305093005.htm"><h5>Teaching Computer to Learn Like Humans</h5></a><p><b>A new study by Paul Rad, assistant director of the UTSA Open Cloud Institute, and Nicole Beebe, Melvin Lachman Distinguished Professor in Entrepreneurship and director of the UTSA Cyber Center for Security and Analytics, describes a new cloud-based learning platform for artificial intelligence (A.I.) that teaches machines to learn like humans.</b><br>

<br>"Cognitive learning is all about teaching computers to learn without having to explicitly program them," Rad said. "In this study, we're presenting an entirely new platform for machine learning to teach computers to learn the way we do."<br>

<br>To build the cloud-based platform, Rad and Beebe studied how education and understanding has evolved over the past five centuries. They wanted to gain a better picture of how computers could be taught to approach deductive reasoning.<br>

<br>"Our goal here is to teach the machine to become smarter, so that it can help us. That's what they're here to do," Rad said. "So how do we become better? We learn from experience."<br>

<br>The UTSA researchers also studied how humans learn across their lifetimes. Children, for example, begin by identifying objects such as faces and toys, then move on from there to understand communication. This process helps their thought processes mature as they get older.<br>

<br>Ultimately, Rad and Beebe want AI agents to learn automatic threat detection. This means the AI agent can dynamically learn network traffic patterns and normal behavior and thus become more effective in discovering and thwarting new attacks before significant damage.<br>

<br>"Or It would be nice if an intelligent computer assistant could aggregate thousands of news items or memos for someone, so that the process of reading that material was quicker and that person could decide almost instantly how to use it," Rad said.<br>

<br>Additionally, intelligent machines could be used in medical diagnoses, which Rad says could lead to more affordable health care, and other fields that require precise, deductive reasoning.<br>

<br>"During the history, humans have invented and used tools such as swords, calculators and cars, and tools have changed human society and enable us to evolve," Rad said. "That's what we're doing here, but on a much more impactful scale."<br>

	<p1>Technology has previously been seen as a disruptive influence in the classroom, but this perception is changing.</p1><br>


<p1><br>
  <em>By Andy Hill, Commercial Director EMEA at Legrand’s Data Communications division</em></p1>

<p>From the apps that are changing how we shop, eat and communicate, to cloud computing that can make anywhere a place of work, technology is moving quickly, and society is having to adapt just as fast.

    The sector must modernise and adapt, in order to provide children and students with the skills they will need as part of a modern workforce.

We have come a long way since the days of chalkboards, but the UK’s educational sector is arguably lagging behind when it comes to building a connected learning environment suited for today’s “digital natives”. The sector must modernise and adapt, in order to provide children and students with the skills they will need as part of a modern workforce.</p><br>

	<p><br>Thankfully, new hardware and software are emerging constantly to provide teachers with the tools they need to engage their students. Knowing what these technologies are is half the battle, so here’s a quick guide:<br>
